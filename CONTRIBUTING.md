## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer functional patterns
- Use async/await over promises
- Handle errors appropriately

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no inline styles)

### File Naming

- Components: `kebab-case.tsx` (e.g., `district-search.tsx`)
- Utilities: `kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `helpers.ts`)
- Pages: `page.tsx` (Next.js App Router convention)

### Git Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add more details in the body if needed

Examples:
```
Add: District search autocomplete functionality
Fix: Leaderboard percentage calculation error
Update: Improve landing page design
Remove: Unused Prisma dependencies
```
